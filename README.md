# sales_data_analysis

In progress....

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variable(s). You need to predict the sales for test data set. The data contains attributes for product as well as for store where it is sold. The goal is to look at these attributes and perform univariate and multivariate analysis. Next up, I will perform feature engineering and build prediction model to predict sales.
